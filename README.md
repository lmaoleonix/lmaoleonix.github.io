Just a simple about me website.
I allow anyone to use it, as well I like for anyone to use it.

Style: The style I was going for was Android-ish.


Newest update: The newest update now offers you that I switched over to ReactJS! And well now I removed for just some time the dark mode support. (Might not add it back).
